# facprojectfour: Fruit Shop Shopping Cart
###### For the fourth project required as part of my application to Founders & Coders, I completed a Fruit Shop Shopping Cart. This was a complicated project to undertake, in which I learnt about the Local Storage function in Google Chrome for the first time. The project involved having two HTML pages - Index and Cart - linked to each other, and to the JavaScript, which included a products array, containing an object for each item.

###### The project involved a number of fuctions. The below table summarises each one.
