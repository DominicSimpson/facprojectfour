# facprojectfour: Fruit Shop Shopping Cart
###### For the fourth project required as part of my application to Founders & Coders, I completed a Fruit Shop Shopping Cart. This was a complicated project to undertake, in which I learnt about the Local Storage function in Google Chrome for the first time. The project involved having two HTML pages - Index and Cart - linked to each other, and to the JavaScript, which included a products array, containing an object for each item.

###### The project involved a number of fuctions. The below table summarises each one.
| Function           | Description |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| onLoadCartNumbers  | Content Cell  |
| cartNumbers        | Content Cell  |
| setItems           | Content Cell  |
| totalCost          | Content Cell  |
| displayCart        | Content Cell  | 
| manageQuantity     | Content Cell  |
| deleteButtons      | Content Cell  |
