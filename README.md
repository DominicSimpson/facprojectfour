# facprojectfour: Fruit Shop Shopping Cart
###### For the fourth project required as part of my application to Founders & Coders, I completed a Fruit Shop Shopping Cart. This was a complicated project to undertake, in which I learnt about the Local Storage function in Google Chrome for the first time. The project involved having two HTML pages - Index and Cart - linked to each other, and to the JavaScript, which included a products array, containing an object for each item.

###### The project involved a number of fuctions. The below table summarises each one.
| Function           | Description |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| onLoadCartNumbers  | checks Local Storage and adds selected items to Cart display on the screen |
| cartNumbers        | Displays how many items have been added to the Cart  |
| setItems           | Matches each Cart item clicked with appropriate object in products array and updates Local Storage accordingly  |
| totalCost          | Increments totalCost numerically as cartCost is converted to a number type  |
| displayCart        | Cart page runs on load and displays items  | 
| manageQuantity     | Increases or decreases quantity of item via item button on screen  |
| deleteButtons      | Content Cell  |
